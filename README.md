# 📜 Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Collaborative Healthcare Data Analysis

> 🔒 Data stays where it belongs.

> 🧠 Intelligence grows across hospitals.

> ⚡ No compromises. No leaks. Only collaboration.

## ✨ Project Overview

In a world where healthcare insights could save lives, one critical barrier stands tall: **privacy** .

This project breaks that barrier — using **Federated Learning (FL)** and **Homomorphic Encryption (HE)** to collaboratively train machine learning models without ever sharing sensitive patient data.

We designed a **Dockerized Federated Learning pipeline** powered by **Flower** and **TensorFlow** , tailored for **healthcare readmission prediction** .

**Security, modularity, and industry-grade scalability** lie at the heart of this architecture.

## 🎯 Motivation

Healthcare organizations worldwide struggle with isolated data silos due to regulations like **HIPAA** and **GDPR** .

Federated Learning emerges as the revolution:

* Collaborate **without centralizing data** .
* Improve models globally while **keeping sensitive data locally** .
* Empower healthcare without breaking trust.

## 🔒 Privacy Approach

We **don’t just federate** — we **encrypt** .

* **Federated Learning** : Clients train models locally and only share updates (never raw data).
* **Homomorphic Encryption** : Model updates are encrypted, ensuring even the coordinating server can't peek into individual updates.
* **Secure Aggregation** : Encrypted updates are aggregated before decryption, preserving the anonymity and integrity of client contributions.

**Result** :

🌟 *"Train together, stay private forever."*

## 🌍 How It Works

1. Each hospital trains **locally** .
2. Sends back **encrypted model weights** (not the patient data!).
3. Server **aggregates encrypted updates** — no server-side peeking.
4. Model **improves globally** after each round.
